# Streaming Implementation

The streaming functionality now uses direct HLS (m3u8) URLs from the 2embed provider without a proxy. The HLS player component handles the video playback directly using:

1. Direct stream access from the provider
2. Built-in CORS handling in the HLSPlayer component
3. Automatic quality selection and adaptation
4. Proper error handling and retry logic

## Configuration

No special proxy configuration is needed. The player will automatically handle HLS stream playback using the browser's native capabilities or the HLS.js library as appropriate.
